The goal was the make a clone of the first level of the original Super Mario Bros. The class put us in teams of four and split the project up into four sprints. We used Agile SCRUM methodologies. There was a decent amount of independence when it came to the project, but instructors and graders provided a lot of feedback on the quality of the code.

I've made much more progress on my team's original work by going with a data driven approach. MonoGame is very code heavy, with a \"code first\" way of making games. But I instead went with a more \"give me data and I'll put what you want on the screen\" approach. The sprites are a good example of that. I have just one sprites class that basically takes in info from a file and uses that to draw the correct image to the screen. The enemies are another decent example. I have just one enemy class that takes in things like color and sprite name. That helps the correct thing be drawn to the screen, and it also still allows for a system where different enemies can interact differently with Mario."))),n.a.createElement(l.y,null,n.a.createElement(l.l,null,n.a.createElement("strong",null,"Sprints"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"A quickdown of the sprints:"),n.a.createElement("strong",null,"Sprint 1"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Sprint 1 was focused on setting up our game objects and giving them states.

We didn't introduce actual physics here, just Pokemon or original Legend of Zelda type movement. The big lesson here wasn't necessarily a design pattern, but more what it means to go into a task trying to envision an overall system. In the first iteration of this, I couldn't tell you how we actually set up our collision detection and response system. We would detect the collision, and then we'd start on this long journey through classes before finally landing at the spot where we actually deal with the collision. There was no symmetry or system to that chain of classes. Each object was different. This alone displayed how important it is to write maintainable and reusable code."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"We never made a second version during class, but I myself have done the project a few times on my own now. This is mainly because I grade for the class, and so I need to know how to do every aspect of the project, and how to do them well. In my third iteration, I finally had a setup where I could tell you how it actually works for every object. I first loop through the game objects and detect collisions using simple AABB (MonoGame actually has it built into their Rectangle type). Then I figure out the type of the two objects using .NET's type system. Third, I pass it off to a class that has a big dictionary. The dictionary takes in tuples of types and spits out a command (Command Pattern here) object whose Execute is called. Fourth, the Execute will call a class that handles collisions for the two types of objects colliding. The Execute of the command knows exactly which method to call as well."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"A quick example: Big Mario collides with a moving Koopa Shell. I detect the collision, figure out it's Mario and a Koopa, pass in Mario's powerup type (Big), the fact it's Mario, the fact it's a Koopa, and the Koopa's movement state (moving), and that gives me a command. This command's Execute will call a method along the lines of HandleNonSmallMarioMovingShellCollision (maybe need to work on the length of the name), and that method will handle the details for resolving the collision.
