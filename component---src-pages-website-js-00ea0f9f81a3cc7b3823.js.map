Especially being in school, I can't just\r\n                put everything on GitHub and tell people to look there. As I've\r\n                developed it though, it has also become a project itself. I'm\r\n                still very new when it comes to designing and using the newest\r\n                technologies, so I'm always open to feedback. As a result of\r\n                this, the website is pretty much constantly being worked on.\r\n                This is now the fourth iteration.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </MDBCol>\r\n          </MDBRow>\r\n          <MDBRow>\r\n            <MDBCol>\r\n              <strong>What's Changed?</strong>\r\n              <p>\r\n                When I first made the site, it was pretty much just straight\r\n                html. There was some simple css, but it was really only\r\n                Bootstrap's. I eventually added some more of my own styling to\r\n                it, but these first two iterations were really just me getting\r\n                comfortable with html and css.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                With the third iteration, I tried to go further in incorporating\r\n                more things. I added some simple javascript to have the navbar\r\n                go from transparent to solid. I redesigned the home page to be\r\n                less of a copy of the navbar. And I tried to move away from\r\n                having too many colors, especially on the navbar. I'd say by\r\n                then, it was obvious I understood enough about html and css, but\r\n                still was reinventing the wheel with a lot of things.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                That last part was important to me. I'd say that's the one part\r\n                about learning to program that isn't always fun: reinventing the\r\n                wheel. And so now, I've built the website using React and\r\n                Gatsby. I've also changed to MDBootstrap, but I from a\r\n                programming point of view, it doesn't seem that much different\r\n                than Twitter Bootstrap. To be honest, I wouldn't at all say I'm\r\n                a React developer or anything. But it's nice to finally move to\r\n                a framework like that so I can focus on the content of the site\r\n                rather than trying to figure out how to make certain components.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Overall though, the styling is very basic, and maybe even a\r\n                little bland. I'm still working on becoming more creative when\r\n                it comes to these things.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </MDBCol>\r\n          </MDBRow>\r\n        </MDBContainer>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default WebsitePage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/third_iteration-82d3a5a14419e613222c911f88c2966b.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/first_iteration-cabae49ca94b8f04421b74d4b1375ac8.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/second_iteration-30ce0174a18b43fba7addfb0d85c6d80.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
