We attached it to the robot, but still had a problem. We needed to be generous when trying to get the object, or else we'd miss it. So, we decided to just move side to side in front of it so that the magnet had the best chance possible of connecting.

We needed to come up with a way that would allow us to move enough to the side while keeping the magnet connected once it was on there."),n.a.createElement("p",null,'First, we build a field goal shaped mechanism. This would hold the pen cap. Between the ends of the two "goal posts", we drilled small holes and ran a string through them. We also drilled small holes in the pen cap and ran the string through that. So now, the pen cap was attached to the string between the "goal posts" with the ability to slide back and forth. That was the key: the pen cap could slide back and forth. And so once it was attached to the object, even if the robot kept moving to the side, the pen cap would just keep sliding, not breaking off the object. It was a maintainable system as well, as if it turned out we needed to move to the side more, we could just make the field goals further apart.'))),n.a.createElement(l.y,null,n.a.createElement(l.l,null,n.a.createElement("strong",null,"Code"),n.a.createElement("p",null,"I haven't mentioned anything from a code point of view, and I've saved it here for last for good reason.
