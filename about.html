				Hi! My name's Dean Haleem, and I'm a third year Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University. I started 
				coding my senior year of high school. Since then I've developed a good understanding of the basics of programming and have used 
				that to further my knowledge of the discipline. I am most comfortable using C# or Java, but am no stranger to C/C++. What made me 
				want to become a software engineer was the possibilities one can do with the skills involved. Out of these, game development has stood 
				out as the most interesting to me, especially being a gamer my entire life.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've always had an interest in making games, and when I realized I wanted to be a programmer, game development was always in the back 
				of my mind. I played FIFA all throughout my childhood, but my favorite game is League of Legends, and after 
				seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKbeDeu5Wbk" target="_blank">Riot's Founding Interns of League of Legends</a>, I 
				decided to fully pursure specializing in game development. Since then, I've mostly learned game development using C# and Micorsoft's 
				XNA Framework through Monogame. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of software development, I enjoy sports and eSports, mostly soccer and League of Legends respectively. I played soccer growing 
				up and also participate in the intramural soccer league at OSU. And of course I love playing video games, recently being FIFA, League 
				of Legends, Super Mario Odyssey, and I'm of course excited for Smash Ultimate this winter.
			</p>
