                <h4 class="text-center"><strong>League of Legends</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    I got into league sophomore year of high school, but really started to get better at it during my senior year in 
                    2015. I'm not too good at it, but what keeps me coming back is the non gameplay things Riot does. From a programming 
                    point of view, I love the <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/" target="_blank">Engineering Blog</a>. From 
                    a fan side, the eSports scene is very well developed and easy to follow. And coming back to gameplay, League is 
                    one of those games that can really challenge you. The amount of precision in the control you have of the champions in 
                    League lead to the potential for amazing plays that only the best players can perform. It has the ability to challenge 
                    you on all fronts. After growing up only playing FIFA, this kind of gameplay kept making me want to come back and improve.

                <h4 class="text-center"><strong>Super Mario Odyssey</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed Nintendo Games, and when the Switch came out, I thought it was only right I get Super Mario 
                    Odyssey along with it. The game fully exceeded my expectations. Perhaps due to playing it after starting to have 
                    more of an appreciation for games after deciding to try to get into game development, I was simply always amazed 
                    at really everything in the game. The graphics, the AI, the world designs, and importantly the mechanics. On the 
                    surface, the game mechanics may seem rather simple, but after watching through the beginning of a speedrun of the game,
                    I saw how even in the first world there are amazing ways to bypass areas and get to the finish line quicker. Having that
                    in a game, similar to what I mentioned with League, is in my opinion so crucial to retaining and also creating a player base.
                    After all, if the game doesn't have any challenging aspects, no one will want to play it.

                <h4 class="text-center"><strong>FIFA</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    To be honest, I hate FIFA. Ever since FIFA 16 I haven't enjoyed playing it at all. But I will always include it 
                    in a list of my favorite games because of my love for soccer in general. FIFA is who I am. I grew up with it and 
                    it alone, never really playing any other game. And so while it doesn't have as much potential for mechanical 
                    plays as League or Odyssey, it is still my game. While it doesn't have exciting stories or gameplay and while in the 
                    end if you know how to play soccer you will probably be pretty decent at FIFA, it is still the game I've played my entire 
                    life, and so must be on this list.
