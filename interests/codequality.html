                        High quality code does what you expect it to do, and it does only that. It performs as efficiently as possible,
                        with minimal dependencies and branching. It is a well written story from one programmer to another, not repeating 
                        itself anywhere throughout. And, most importantly, high quality code is written to be improved by others, not 
                        changed by yourself.

                When I first learned about the concept of high quality code, I immediately dove into finding ways to make 
                my code match the standards. I read 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank"><em>Clean Code</em></a>,
                which to be honest was the first bit of reading I had done in quite a while. But it was well worth it. I also did research 
                on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID Design Principles</a> and incorporated them into 
                my code.

                On top of this, I was in CSE 3902 at Ohio State, a class that taught many things, one of which was code quality. After 
                enjoying the class, I was lucky enough to become an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for it. I've loved being in a 
                position to share my opinion of what is considered high quality code to others as well as help them form their own 
                opinions of it. I think it's very important for developers to have their own definition of high quality code. It gives 
                us that consistency that helps everyone understand our code from project to project.
