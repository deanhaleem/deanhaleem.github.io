                <h2 class="text-center"><strong>Fifa is broken.</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    I have been playing every FIFA as it came out since FIFA 10, and I played
                    many different editions of FIFA before that for many different consoles. And it seems every year, the gameplay gets
                    worse and worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm glad EA focuses on things other than gameplay. And I'm sure they do that for a very good reason as the game still
                    sells well and everything. But as I want to get more into game development, I want to see which area of game
                    development interests me. And I still haven't decided, but something that will always interest me is AI. And that's
                    thanks to FIFA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, FIFA is broken. But I'd say it was FIFA 19 that really seemed like everything was a mess. What in my opinion
                    has really always been broken is the AI, specifically the defending. Now, when I say broken, it's coming from someone
                    who has played the position throughout his whole life in the sport and has also dedicated time to learning about
                    the position in general. In reality, I bet FIFA's AI does almost exactly what EA want it to. What that is, however,
                    is far from correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the two pictures on the left, it doesn't seem like there is anything to notice. Breaking it down, the ball was
                    just kicked down the field by the goalkeeper of the team in white. So there are two attackers (in white) and three
                    defenders (in red). Just from a common sense point of view, it doesn't make sense that two attackers could so easily
                    get by three defenders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But this is a sport after all and not math, so two beating three happens all the time. But it takes skill and thought.
                    Here, the user just passed to his attacking teammate as usual, without thinking of how to get by the three defenders.
                    Why? <strong>Because the defenders in FIFA take themselves out of the game</strong>. We see three defenders here, but
                    notice the icon above on of them. Another user is controlling that defender. This situation is actually a 2v1 in favor
                    of the attackers. This is due to the lack of knowledge by the AI defenders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the furthest back defender in the top image, he obviously has no intention of playing anyone offside. So why stop
                    when you can see the attacker is trying to play it to his teammate making the run? Stopping causes the defender to have
                    to speed back up, obviously allowed the attacker to get in behind. That simple choice of stopping caused a goal to be
                    let in. And that was it. That was the only reason. As a player, there is nothing more frustrating. Such a simple action
                    caused the worst outcome. <strong>Moments like that are what made me want to become a game developer, and this moment is
                    particular makes me think perhaps I should pursue AI</strong>.
