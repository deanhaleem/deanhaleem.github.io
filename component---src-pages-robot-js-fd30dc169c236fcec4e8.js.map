The goal is to finish as quickly\r\n                as possible. During my team's year (2017), the obstacles were\r\n                turning a satellite, holding a button down for five seconds,\r\n                flipping a switch, pulling an object out of a wall, and placing\r\n                that object into one of two bins. To decide which bin, the robot\r\n                would detect the color of a light and decide based on that.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                My team's design involved using Omni Wheels. While this made it\r\n                very simple to navigate and code, it did limit us as there were\r\n                few motors available that could hook up to the wheels. This took\r\n                away from how fast our robot could go, but we still consistently\r\n                finished the course within a minute.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                More information about the competition can be found{\" \"}\r\n                <a href=\"https://eed.osu.edu/robot-competition\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n                  here\r\n                </a>\r\n                .\r\n              </p>\r\n            </MDBCol>\r\n          </MDBRow>\r\n          <MDBRow>\r\n            <MDBCol>\r\n              <figure className=\"figure\" className=\"text-center\">\r\n                <img\r\n                  src={CourseImage}\r\n                  className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n                  alt=\"\"\r\n                />\r\n                <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n                  Top view of the course for my team's semester.\r\n                </figcaption>\r\n              </figure>\r\n            </MDBCol>\r\n          </MDBRow>\r\n          <MDBRow>\r\n            <MDBCol>\r\n              <strong>Challenges</strong>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The biggest challenge for most teams was pulling the object out\r\n                of the wall. The reason for this was that the task lied in the\r\n                \"dead zone\". As a result, the robot couldn't use the positioning\r\n                system it used everywhere else. For us especially, this proved a\r\n                challenge due to the omni-wheels coupled with our poor storage\r\n                of the robot.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                We kept the robot in a cardboard box that one team member would\r\n                just carry to and from his dorm. Looking back, probably not the\r\n                smartest move. This causes us to start every day readjusting the\r\n                wheels so that they would take the robot straight forward. The\r\n                omni-wheels seemed to be causing much more trouble in that\r\n                regard compared to other teams' wheels.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </MDBCol>\r\n          </MDBRow>\r\n          <MDBRow>\r\n            <MDBCol>\r\n              <strong>\r\n                Winning 1st Place in Outstanding Achievment in Innovation\r\n              </strong>\r\n              <p>\r\n                As mentioned earlier, the biggest challenge for most teams was\r\n                pulling the object from the wall. This is where we won this\r\n                award.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The object had a magnetic circle in the middle of it, so we\r\n                approached the problem with our goal being to pull it out using\r\n                that. We had a magnet, but we needed something to hold it in and\r\n                attach that to our robot. One of the team members simply took a\r\n                pen cap and put the magnet in that. We attached it to the robot,\r\n                but still had a problem. We needed to be generous when trying to\r\n                get the object, or else we'd miss it. So, we decided to just\r\n                move side to side in front of it so that the magnet had the best\r\n                chance possible of connecting. With the current setup, though,\r\n                if we went too hard to the side, the magnet would break off of\r\n                the object. We needed to come up with a way that would allow us\r\n                to move enough to the side while keeping the magnet connected\r\n                once it was on there.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                First, we build a field goal shaped mechanism. This would hold\r\n                the pen cap. Between the ends of the two \"goal posts\", we\r\n                drilled small holes and ran a string through them. We also\r\n                drilled small holes in the pen cap and ran the string through\r\n                that. So now, the pen cap was attached to the string between the\r\n                \"goal posts\" with the ability to slide back and forth. That was\r\n                the key: the pen cap could slide back and forth. And so once it\r\n                was attached to the object, even if the robot kept moving to the\r\n                side, the pen cap would just keep sliding, not breaking off the\r\n                object. It was a maintainable system as well, as if it turned\r\n                out we needed to move to the side more, we could just make the\r\n                field goals further apart.\r\n              </p>\r\n              {/* <figure className=\"figure\" className=\"text-center\">\r\n                <img\r\n                  src=\"https://mdbootstrap.com/img/Photos/Horizontal/Nature/8-col/img%20(73).jpg\"\r\n                  className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n                  alt=\"\"\r\n                  style={{ width: \"400px\" }}\r\n                />\r\n                <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n                  Slightly hard to see, but towards the top right of the robot,\r\n                  the wooden fork with the pen cap is what we came up with.\r\n                </figcaption>\r\n              </figure> */}\r\n            </MDBCol>\r\n          </MDBRow>\r\n          <MDBRow>\r\n            <MDBCol>\r\n              <strong>Code</strong>\r\n              <p>\r\n                I haven't mentioned anything from a code point of view, and I've\r\n                saved it here for last for good reason. There really wasn't\r\n                anything to it. With the omni-wheels, we never had to worry\r\n                about anything other than how much power to give certain motors\r\n                and for how long. As a result, most of the code looked like\r\n                this.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <ul className=\"list-unstyled text-center\">\r\n                <li>\r\n                  <code>northeastMotor.power(90);</code>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  <code>northwestMotor.power(90);</code>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  <code>//go for x amount of seconds</code>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  <code>//stop motors.
