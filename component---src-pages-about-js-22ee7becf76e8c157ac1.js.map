My name's Dean Haleem, and I'm a third year Computer Science\r\n              and Engineering student at The Ohio State University. I started\r\n              coding my senior year of high school. Since then, I've developed a\r\n              good understanding of the basics of programming and have used that\r\n              to further my knowledge of the discipline. I am most comfortable\r\n              using C# or Java, but am no stranger to C/C++. What made me want\r\n              to become a software engineer was the possibilities one can do\r\n              with the skills involved. Out of these, game development has stood\r\n              out as the most interesting to me, especially being a gamer my\r\n              entire life.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I've always had an interest in making games, and when I realized I\r\n              wanted to be a programmer, game development was always in the back\r\n              of my mind. I do love programming in general, but when it comes to\r\n              games, I always find myself wanting to do more. Wanting to take\r\n              the project to the next level. And I'm sure this stems from\r\n              knowing what it's like to be the player. Currently, I am learning\r\n              the fundamentals of game development through Unity and MonoGame. I\r\n              hope to expand on my skill and tool sets soon, hopefully adding\r\n              C++ and Unreal Engine to them.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Outside of software development, I enjoy sports and eSports,\r\n              mostly soccer and League of Legends respectively. I played soccer\r\n              growing up and also participate in the intramural soccer league at\r\n              OSU. And of course I love playing video games, recently being\r\n              FIFA, League of Legends, and Super Mario Odyssey.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </MDBCol>\r\n        </MDBRow>\r\n      </MDBContainer>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default AboutPage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/dean-30c014a04f26bb03dbdedd6cb80ff2c0.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
